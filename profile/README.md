### 🙋‍♀️ Introduction

We are open-source electronic signing platform. In fact, we’ve been doing this since April, 2023. 

### 🎯 Objective

To build an open-source electronic signing platform that is complaint with rules and regulations of each country, while also ad-free.

### 🌈 Contribution guidelines

We appreciate any and all contributions, and hence we have outlined contribution guidelines for each repo or project. 

It is done so because some require a basic signing requirement for contributions (we call it the **Level 1** signing requirement) and some require a special signing requirement for contributions (we call it the **Level 0** signing requirement).

We kindly request that you review each of them before you start working on the repo or project.
